-there is no god here, only me and nothing more
-who are you?
-you feel nothing, but the dried up blood flaking down your collar. it is not
your own, but rather the offspring of your own madness.
-these voices are familiar
-i have no mouth and i must scream
-my little one, how far down the rabbithole have you gone?
-as you awake from your slumber, you feel a sudden urge to be put back asleep,
the realization that you will never feel joy again grows stronger with every
breath.
-it wont stop, it never stops
-looking down at the corpse of your lifelong friend, and as the realization
comes all you can do is laugh.
-the breaking and tearing of your mental is irreversable.
-you feel the darkness swell over you, the abscence of god is no longer a fear
but a blessing. you have become more, so much more than the emotional bag of
meat you once were. you have become what you fear.
-as the blade pierces your heart, you finally feel a sense of calm. a sweet
release that has been long delayed. and as your breathing grows slower and blood
runs cold, all you can do is smile. finally, you can sleep. "sleep child, sleep"
